    doc: the Pindel input file; either this, a pindel configuration file (consisting
      of multiple pindel filenames) or a bam configuration file is required
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --pindel-file

  output_prefix:
    type: ['null', string]
    doc: Output prefix; Optional parameters -
    inputBinding:

  pindel_config_file:
    type: ['null', string]
    doc: the pindel config file, containing the names of all Pindel files that need

  chromosome:
    type: ['null', string]
    doc: Which chr/fragment. Pindel will process reads for one chromosome each time.
      ChrName must be the same as in reference sequence and in read file. '-c ALL'
      will make Pindel loop over all chromosomes. The search for indels and SVs can
      also be limited to a specific region; -c 20 -10,000,000 will only look for indels
      and SVs after position 10,000,000 = [10M, end], -c 20 -5,000,000-15,000,000
      will report indels in the range between and including the bases at position
      5,000,000 and 15,000,000 = [5M, 15M]. (default ALL)
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --chromosome

  RP:
    type: ['null', boolean]
    default: false
    doc: search for discordant read-pair to improve sensitivity (default true)
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --RP

  min_distance_to_the_end:
    type: ['null', string]
    doc: the minimum number of bases required to match reference (default 8).
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --min_distance_to_the_end

  number_of_threads:
    type: ['null', string]
    doc: the number of threads Pindel will use (default 1).
    default: '6'
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --number_of_threads

  max_range_index:
    type: ['null', string]
    doc: the maximum size of structural variations to be detected; the higher this
      number, the greater the number of SVs reported, but the computational cost and
      memory requirements increase, as does the rate of false positives. 1=128, 2=512,
      3=2,048, 4=8,092, 5=32,368, 6=129,472, 7=517,888, 8=2,071,552, 9=8,286,208.
      (maximum 9, default 2)
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --max_range_index

  window_size:
    type: ['null', string]
    doc: for saving RAM, divides the reference in bins of X million bases and only
      analyzes the reads that belong in the current bin, (default 5 (=5 million))
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --window_size

  sequencing_error_rate:
    type: ['null', string]
    doc: the expected fraction of sequencing errors (default 0.01)
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --sequencing_error_rate

  sensitivity:
    type: ['null', string]
    doc: Pindel only reports reads if they can be fit around an event within a certain
      number of mismatches. If the fraction of sequencing errors is 0.01, (so we'd
      expect a total error rate of 0.011 since on average 1 in 1000 bases is a SNP)
      and pindel calls a deletion, but there are 4 mismatched bases in the new fit
      of the pindel read (100 bases) to the reference genome, Pindel would calculate
      that with an error rate of 0.01 (=0.011 including SNPs) the chance that there
      are 0, 1 or 2 mismatched bases in the reference genome is 90%%. Setting -E to
      .90 (=90%%) will thereforethrow away all reads with 3 or more mismatches, even
      though that means that you throw away 1 in 10 valid reads. Increasing this parameter
      to say 0.99 will increase the sensitivity of pindel though you may get more
      false positives, decreasing the parameter ensures you only get very good matches
      but pindel may not find as many events. (default 0.95)
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --sensitivity

  maximum_allowed_mismatch_rate:
